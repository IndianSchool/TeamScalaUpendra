Spark and Scala:
----------------

Language Classification: based on ease-of-use to humans

Low Level => understandable by computer not by human. ex: machine language [000100010]
Mid Level => so so understandable by both computer and human. ex: c language [abc.c;abc.obj;abc.exe] [int i]
High Level => not understandable by computer and understandable by human. ex: java language [cycle c; human h]

Script Level => not only human understandable but it also assumes human intention. 
				rules are a bit relaxed. ex: javascript language, vb script, scala, python, r
				code looks very small. [var a = 15]

if the code is big => we can go through and understand what is happening. 
						But writing code will take more time, error prone.
						
if the code is small => few lines of code is needed. easy to write.
						Since its consice nature, you need know upfront meaning of the shortcut.
						abc(_+_); difficult to debug for a new guy
				

Java has only BATCH mode.
Java is an OBJECT ORIENTED Language.
Java is a high level language

Scala has both INTERACTIVE and BATCH
	> INTERACTIVE > commands
	> BATCH > code, compile, build, deploy, execute
Scala is both OBJECT ORIENTED and FUNCTIONAL language.

HelloWorld Program:
-------------------

1. To enter into scala prompt, we need to start the scala shell
	a. Open Terminal on the linux machine
	b. type "scala" (without quotes)
	c. this will take you to scala shell
	d. you will see a prompt like "scala>"
	e. on the prompt we can type the commands
	
example:

scala> print("HelloWorld")
HelloWorld

Note: no need to use semi-colon as a termination character, system will understand
