// this program is designed to give error
// to show that a value defined using val cannot be redefined in code
// you will get error at "val x = 20" line
// but this redefinition to the same name is possible in interactive shell

// you dont need to compile the code before execting it
// scala can directly execute a code file
// $ scala Test.scala -- it works, noneed to do "scalac"
